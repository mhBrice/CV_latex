# CV_latex

This is my Curriculum Vitae created with XeLaTex. Template forked from [KevCaz](https://github.com/KevCaz) and inspired by [SteveViss](https://github.com/SteveViss).

KevCaz added some useful icons in the CV and used the [fontawesome-latex](https://github.com/xdanaux/fontawesome-latex)
package kindly made available by [xdanaux](https://github.com/xdanaux).


# Tout doux
