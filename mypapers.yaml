    Aim: In urbanized areas, exotic invasions, native extinctions, and the
    alteration of habitats and natural processes drive homogenization, which is
    a form of biotic impoverishment. This study examines whether urbanization
    and flooding induce homogenization of herbaceous communities in riparian
    forests and quantifies the relationships between taxonomic and functional
    β-­diversity.

    Methods: Species plant composition was inventoried in 57 riparian forests
    located along a gradient of urbanization. To analyse plant communities in
    terms of their trait composition, community-weighted means were calculated
    using eight functional traits. Forests were characterized by local (physical
    features, hydrological regime and historical disturbances) and landscape
    (surrounding land use) variables. Spatial processes structuring communities
    were assessed using Moran’s eigenvector maps and asymmetric eigenvector
    maps. The relative importance of these three subsets (local, landscape and
    spatial variables) on tree, shrub and herb functional composition was
    quantiﬁed by variation partitioning using redundancy analyses.

    Results: Functional patterns in riparian forests resulted primarily from
    environmental ﬁltering (local and landscape variables). Local conditions,
    especially ﬂood intensity, exerted an overriding selection pressure on
    functional composition of riparian plant communities. Urbanization seemed to
    act indirectly on trait patterns through the alteration of hydrological
    disturbances caused by ongoing and historical land transformation.
    Nevertheless, dispersal along rivers was also a signiﬁcant structuring
    force, while overland dispersal was negligible.

    Conclusions: Our study highlights that under severe natural disturbance
    regimes, the effect of natural ﬁlters outweighed the negative effects of
    urban ﬁlters. However, the alteration of natural ﬂooding processes by human
    activities is also a major mechanism inﬂuencing plant trait composition in
    urban riparian communities as forests subjected to reduced ﬂooding intensity
    experienced a greater effect of urbanization. The effects of urbanization
    and of past land uses on plant communities were greater for trees than for
    shrubs and herbs due to the high turnover rate of the latter. Finally, our
    results showed the importance of dispersal along rivers for biodiversity
    even in fragmented urban landscapes.

    Urbanization results in ecosystem fragmentation, habitat loss, and altered
    environmental conditions that usually favour pioneer and ruderal species.
    The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of urban conditions
    on liana abundance in temperate forests. Fieldwork was conducted in 50
    forests of the metropolitan Montréal area (Quebec, Canada) and focused on
    the 6 most common lianas of the study area, Celastrus scandens, Menispermum
    canadense, Parthenocissus quinquefolia, Solanum dulcamara, Toxicodendron
    radicans, and Vitis riparia. Potential drivers of liana distribution at the
    landscape scale (e.g., surrounding land use, urban heat island) were
    quantified based on satellite images and land use maps. At the forest scale,
    we investigated biotic and abiotic variables in 429 sampling plots. We found
    that at the landscape scale, lianas benefited from urbanization, mainly
    through warm microclimates created by urban heat islands (UHI) as lianas are
    not well adapted to cold climates. At the forest scale, lianas were more
    abundant in disturbed forests and in edge habitats than in less disturbed
    forest and core habitats. Their fast growth rate enables them to quickly
    take advantage of high light availability on disturbed sites. Our results
    suggest that urbanization and ongoing climate changes will lead to an
    increase in liana abundance in temperate forests.

  abstract: >-
    Globally, lake fish communities are being subjected to a range of
    scale-dependent anthropogenic pressures, from climate change to
    eutrophication, and from over-exploitation to species introductions. As a
    consequence, the composition of these communities is being reshuffled, in
    most cases leading to a surge in taxonomic similarity at the regional scale
    termed homogenization. The drivers of homogenization remain unclear, which
    may be a reflection of interactions between various environmental changes.
    In this study, we investigate two potential drivers of the recent changes in
    the composition of freshwater fish communities: recreational fishing and
    climate change. Our results, derived from 524 lakes of Ontario, Canada
    sampled in two periods (1965-1982 and 2008-2012), demonstrate that the main
    contributors to homogenization are the dispersal of gamefish species, most
    of which are large predators. Alternative explanations relating to lake
    habitat (e.g., area, phosphorus) or variations in climate have limited
    explanatory power. Our analysis suggests that humanassisted migration is the
    primary driver of the observed compositional shifts, homogenizing freshwater
    fish community among Ontario lakes and generating food webs dominated by
    gamefish species.

    Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used,
    particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems – such
    as communities – through networks of interactions between their components
    indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The
    methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous
    approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new
    perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address
    new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological
    hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways
    that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their
    limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network
    approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so
    far, with – what we believe to be – their appropriate uses and potential
    limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics,
    but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and
    ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species
    interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological
    information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the
    types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to
    local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future
    perspectives. Specifically, we show how the organization of species
    interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more
    or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to
    describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare
    communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we
    illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional
    and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the
    organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test
    the significance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful
    avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological
    questions.

  abstract: >-
    In January 1998, eastern North America experienced the worst ice storm ever
    recorded, which resulted in major damage to forests throughout the region.
    However, we know little about the long-term effects of such a severe weather
    event, or how its potential interaction with other biotic factors impacted
    tree mortality. In this study, we investigated the long-term influence of
    the 1998 ice storm on tree mortality in Boisé-des-Muir ecological reserve,
    an old-growth forest in southern Québec (Canada). Mortality rates for four
    out of the five tree species studied showed a striking increase a few years
    after the ice storm, between 2000 and 2004. After this peak, tree mortality
    rates remained higher than before 1998. These results indicate a lagged and
    persistent effect of the ice storm on tree mortality and suggest that the
    tree community of Boisé-des-Muir was more severely impacted than previously
    reported. Tree species were differentially damaged by the ice storm, and
    more than 25% of all tree species lost more than half their crown. Using a
    Cox proportional hazard model, we evaluated the impact of different levels
    of initial canopy damage from the ice storm on long-term tree mortality
    while taking into account other important biotic factors, such as tree size,
    tree density, indices of species-specific competition, and the presence of
    the beech scale insect. Species differed in their response to the storm,
    suggesting fundamental differences in sensitivity to extreme weather events.
    In particular, eastern hop-hornbeam (Ostrya virginiana) and American beech
    (Fagus grandifolia) were the species most vulnerable to the ice storm, and
    severe canopy loss led to a large increase in mortality risk. These findings
    suggest that the difference in tree survival following a natural disturbance
    likely depends not only on the severity of the damage itself, but also on
    species-specific ability to repair injuries and maintain physiological
    processes. We also found that tree size and species-specific competition
    influenced tree mortality significantly but did not interact with level of
    canopy loss. Consequently, multiple biotic factors remain important to
    explain mortality even after a major disturbance and should be considered
    when evaluating tree mortality. Our results show that the impact of the ice
    storm on tree mortality was species-specific, lagged and persisted for
    several years after the disturbance, potentially resulting in long-term
    compositional changes in the forest. This underscores the necessity of
    conducting long-term monitoring studies to understand the complete impacts
    of ice storms and other extreme climatic events on forests.
