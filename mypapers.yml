    Methods: Species plant composition was inventoried in 57 riparian forests
    located along a gradient of urbanization. To analyse plant communities in
    terms of their trait composition, community-weighted means were calculated
    using eight functional traits. Forests were characterized by local (physical
    features, hydrological regime and historical disturbances) and landscape
    (surrounding land use) variables. Spatial processes structuring communities
    were assessed using Moran’s eigenvector maps and asymmetric eigenvector
    maps. The relative importance of these three subsets (local, landscape and
    spatial variables) on tree, shrub and herb functional composition was
    quantiﬁed by variation partitioning using redundancy analyses.

    Results: Functional patterns in riparian forests resulted primarily from
    environmental ﬁltering (local and landscape variables). Local conditions,
    especially ﬂood intensity, exerted an overriding selection pressure on
    functional composition of riparian plant communities. Urbanization seemed to
    act indirectly on trait patterns through the alteration of hydrological
    disturbances caused by ongoing and historical land transformation.
    Nevertheless, dispersal along rivers was also a signiﬁcant structuring
    force, while overland dispersal was negligible.

    Conclusions: Our study highlights that under severe natural disturbance
    regimes, the effect of natural ﬁlters outweighed the negative effects of
    urban ﬁlters. However, the alteration of natural ﬂooding processes by human
    activities is also a major mechanism inﬂuencing plant trait composition in
    urban riparian communities as forests subjected to reduced ﬂooding intensity
    experienced a greater effect of urbanization. The effects of urbanization
    and of past land uses on plant communities were greater for trees than for
    shrubs and herbs due to the high turnover rate of the latter. Finally, our
    results showed the importance of dispersal along rivers for biodiversity
    even in fragmented urban landscapes.

    Does urbanization lead to taxonomic and functional homogenization in
    riparian forests?

    Aim: In urbanized areas, exotic invasions, native extinctions, and the
    alteration of habitats and natural processes drive homogenization, which is
    a form of biotic impoverishment. This study examines whether urbanization
    and flooding induce homogenization of herbaceous communities in riparian
    forests and quantifies the relationships between taxonomic and functional
    β-­diversity.

  title: Liana distribution in response to urbanization in temperate forests

  abstract: >-
    Urbanization results in ecosystem fragmentation, habitat loss, and altered
    environmental conditions that usually favour pioneer and ruderal species.
    The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of urban conditions
    on liana abundance in temperate forests. Fieldwork was conducted in 50
    forests of the metropolitan Montréal area (Quebec, Canada) and focused on
    the 6 most common lianas of the study area, Celastrus scandens, Menispermum
    canadense, Parthenocissus quinquefolia, Solanum dulcamara, Toxicodendron
    radicans, and Vitis riparia. Potential drivers of liana distribution at the
    landscape scale (e.g., surrounding land use, urban heat island) were
    quantified based on satellite images and land use maps. At the forest scale,
    we investigated biotic and abiotic variables in 429 sampling plots. We found
    that at the landscape scale, lianas benefited from urbanization, mainly
    through warm microclimates created by urban heat islands (UHI) as lianas are
    not well adapted to cold climates. At the forest scale, lianas were more
    abundant in disturbed forests and in edge habitats than in less disturbed
    forest and core habitats. Their fast growth rate enables them to quickly
    take advantage of high light availability on disturbed sites. Our results
    suggest that urbanization and ongoing climate changes will lead to an
    increase in liana abundance in temperate forests.

    Analysing ecological networks of species interactions: Analyzing ecological
    networks
  container-title: Biological Reviews
  source: Crossref
  abstract: >-
    Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used,
    particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems – such
    as communities – through networks of interactions between their components
    indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The
    methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous
    approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new
    perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address
    new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological
    hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways
    that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their
    limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network
    approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so
    far, with – what we believe to be – their appropriate uses and potential
    limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics,
    but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and
    ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species
    interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological
    information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the
    types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to
    local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future
    perspectives. Speciﬁcally, we show how the organization of species
    interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more
    or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to
    describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare
    communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we
    illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional
    and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the
    organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test
    the signiﬁcance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful
    avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological
    questions.
